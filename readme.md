64-bit Tiano Core UEFI for the Raspberry Pi 3
=============================================

Last updated December 15th, 2017.

This is an implementation of a 64-bit UEFI firmware for the RPi3 platform,
based off Ard Bisheuvel's 64-bit http://www.workofard.com/2017/02/uefi-on-the-pi/
and Microsoft's 32-bit https://github.com/ms-iot/RPi-UEFI/tree/ms-iot/Pi3BoardPkg.

Initially, this was supposed to be an easy walk in the park, where
the Microsoft drivers just sorta slide into Ard's UEFI implementation,
and I call it a day. It turned out to be a bit more frustrating of an
experience than that :-).

# Purpose

This is meant as a generally useful 64-bit UEFI implementation for the Pi3, good
enough for most kinds of UEFI development and good enough for running real operating
systems. It has been validated to install and boot Linux and FreeBSD.

# Features

Here is a comparison table between different available EFI firmware implementations
for the RPi3.

| Feature | This Implementation | Ard's  | Microsoft's | U-Boot |

| **Bitness** | 64-bit | 64-bit | 32-bit | Either |
| **PSCI CPU_ON**  | Yes | No | No | No |
| **PSCI SYSTEM_RESET** | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| **DT** | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Pass-through DT** | Yes | No | N/A | Yes |

# Building

1. Clone https://github.com/tianocore/edk2.git (last validated known-good SHA is `c3cb333e097036764afe240b179056ab8e320071` (Mon Nov 20 15:34:17 2017 +0800)).

2. Clone this repo.

3. Apply the [various patches against the edk2 tree](edk2Patches). Yes, it sucks to have to do this, but this is a clearer way forward than forking every single Tiano driver that has a bug in it, or worse - carrying around an entire private fork of edk2. You're welcome to upstream these patches!

4. Run the following script to build.

```
export WORKSPACE=$PWD
export PACKAGES_PATH=$WORKSPACE/edk2:$WORKSPACE/RaspberryPiPkg
export EDK_TOOLS_PATH=$WORKSPACE/edk2/BaseTools
export GCC5_AARCH64_PREFIX=aarch64-linux-gnu-

make -C $EDK_TOOLS_PATH
echo $EDK_TOOLS_PATH
. $WORKSPACE/edk2/edksetup.sh BaseTools

build -b DEBUG -a AARCH64 -t GCC5 -p RaspberryPiPkg/RaspberryPiPkg.dsc
build -b RELEASE -a AARCH64 -t GCC5 -p RaspberryPiPkg/RaspberryPiPkg.dsc
```

If you want to build your own ATF, instead of using the checked-in binaries, follow
the additional directions under [`Binary/atf/readme.md`](Binary/atf/readme.md).

# Using

## Basic

UEFI boot media can be an SD card or USB mass storage, if you've enabled USB booting previously in the OTP (i.e. via `program_usb_boot_mode=1`).

Place the following files on empty boot media:
- `bootcode.bin`, `fixup.dat` and `start.elf` from https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware
- `RPI_EFI.fd`, the actual UEFI firmware built, e.g. `$WORKSPACE/Build/RaspberryPiPkg-AARCH64/RELEASE_GCC5/FV/RPI_EFI.fd`.

SHA `bcd3b8ff86949659e9eec20fd46bf27a2fcb971a` is the latest validated known-good commit for https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware.

You *may not* have a kernel.img (or kernelX.img, where X is a digit) in the root
catalogue of the boot media. It will *not* boot.

The most basic `config.txt` contents are:
```
arm_control=0x200
enable_uart=1
armstub=RPI_EFI.fd
disable_commandline_tags=1
```

This will boot UEFI and expose a device tree that is compatible with openSUSE Leap 42.2/42.3.

Of course use the debug variant (e.g. `$WORKSPACE/Build/RaspberryPiPkg-AARCH64/DEBUG_GCC5/FV/RPI_EFI.fd`)
if necessary, but it will boot a lot slower due to the verbose spew.

Both HDMI and the mini UART serial port are used as the output device.
Only the mini UART serial port is available as an input device (today).

If there are no bootable media, you should be looking at the UEFI Shell. If you hit
the ESCAPE key when prompted, you'll be able to interact with the setup screen and
boot manager.

Note: you cannot boot 32-bit OSes like Raspbian with this firmware. Aw, shucks, right?

## Custom Device Tree

Most likely, if you boot an OS other than openSUSE Leap 42.2, you will need to pass your own
kernel version and distro-specific device tree. This will need to be extracted from the
distributed media or from a running system (e.g that was booted via U-Boot).

This involves a few changes to the above `config.txt`:
```
...
disable_commandline_tags=2
device_tree_address=0x8000
device_tree_end=0x10000
device_tree=my_fdt.dtb
```

Note: the address range **must** be [0x8000:0x10000). `dtoverlay` and `dtparam` parameters are also supported.

## Custom `bootargs`

This firmware will honor the command line passed by the GPU via `cmdline.txt`.

Note, that the ultimate contents of `/chosen/bootargs` are a combination of several pieces:
- Original `/chosen/bootargs` if using the internal DTB. Seems to be completely discarded by GPU when booting with a custom device tree.
- GPU-passed hardware configuration. This one is always present.
- Additional boot options passed via `cmdline.txt`.

## openSUSE Leap 42.3

Download the Leap 42.3 RPi image first, from http://download.opensuse.org/ports/aarch64/distribution/leap/42.3/appliances/

- `dd` image to media.
- If booting UEFI from same media:
  - In the `EFI` partition, delete everything but the `EFI` folder.
  - Follow the [basic steps for booting UEFI](#basic).

Login is `root`/`linux`. There is also a login available on the serial port.

**Note: if your media is USB, after first boot  you must follow these steps, or you will have an unbootable system after first reboot:**
- Edit the file /etc/dracut.conf.d/raspberrypi_modules.conf to include as its first line:
```add_drivers+=" bcm2835-sdhost bcm2835_dma sdhci_bcm2835 dwc2 usbnet uas usb_storage usbcore usb_common "```
- mkinitrd

## FreeBSD (r326622)

- Download
http://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/ISO-IMAGES/12.0/FreeBSD-12.0-CURRENT-arm64-aarch64-RPI3-20171206-r326622.img.xz
- Uncompress and `dd` to media.
- If booting UEFI from same media:
  - Delete everything from the `MSDOSBOOT` partition, except:
    - `EFI`
    - `overlays`
    - `bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb`
  - Follow the [basic steps for booting UEFI to boot from media](#basic).
- If not booting UEFI from same media:
  - Follow the [basic steps for booting UEFI to boot from media](#basic).
  - Copy `bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb` and `overlays` to the UEFI boot media.

Now replace `config.txt` in the UEFI boot media with:
```
arm_control=0x200
armstub=RPI_EFI.fd
enable_uart=1
disable_commandline_tags=2
dtoverlay=mmc
dtparam=audio=on,i2c_arm=on,spi=on
device_tree_address=0x8000
device_tree_end=0x10000
device_tree=bcm2710-rpi-3-b.dtb
```

For a different (newer) release, you will need to look at the original `config.txt`.

This should boot to login prompt on HDMI with USB HID as the input. Login is `root`/`root`.

Note: you must remove `dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt`, if present, from `config.txt`, as both ATF and UEFI rely on the mini UART being initialized.

PL011 serial console in FreeBSD is not supported, yet.

# Bugs in Implemented Functionality

## ATF

- System shutdown (via PSCI) causes overheating.

## SD

- MMC cards are untested.
- Non-SDHC/SDXC are untested.
- SD is slow as high-speed is not implemented.
- No card removal/replacement detection, tons of timeouts and slow down during boot without an SD card present.

## USB

- No USB hotplug support due to unimplemented periodic transfers.
- No HID device support due to unimplemented periodic transfers and unimplemented split interrupt transfers.
- No low/full-speed mass storage devices due to unimplemented split bulk transfers (USB2 and USB3 devices are fine).

## ACPI

- No tables beyond SPCR.

# Missing Functionality

- Network booting.
- Ability to switch UART use to PL011.
- Ability to switch SD card to the `SdHostDxe` driver.
- Persisted EFI variables.

Btw, feel free to upstream, if so inclined.
